                        <p class="synopsis-text" id="tribute-info">The dutch artist produced lithographs, mezzotints (printmaking) and woodcuts. His art was heavily mathematical influenced, in which he experimented with geometry, reflections, illusions, hyperbolic geometry, stellated polyhedra and tessellations. In his early artworks, he was inspired by landscapes, insects and plant, but later on he got more interested in mathematical structures. Today he is well known world wide, but during his lifetime he struggled to make a living from his profession. When he reached the age of 70, an exhibition was held. He talked to mathematicians like Harold Coxeter, Roger Renrose and George Pólya – but also with the crystallographer Friedrich Haag for the tessellations.</p>

                                <p><b>1903–1918</b> Maurits Cornelis Escher was a sickly child, but finished his primory and secondary school in Arnhem.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1918</b> He went to the Technical College of Delft. </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1919–1922</b> He went to Haarlem’s School of Architecture and Decorative Arts, where he learned about drawings and woodcuts.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1922</b> Escher traveled to Italy and visited Florence, Sienna, etc., but also Spain. There he visited Alhambra and discovered his interest in tessellations.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1923–1935</b> Escher lived in Rome, met his wife Jetta Umiker and founded a family with their sons Giorgio, Arthur and Jan. But he would still visit different cities. For Escher the political situation in 1935 was unacceptable, even if he wasn’t interested in politics.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>In <b>May/June 1936</b> he again traveled to Alhambra and drew the mosaics in details.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1937</b> he finished his studies, came back and started working mainly in his studio and focused on geometry. His art already depicted a notion of perspective, unusual and multiple points of view. The family moved to Uccle, Belgium.</p> 
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1941</b> due to world war II he and his family had to move again to Baarn, Netherlands, where he lived until 1970. This period counts as his late, but well-known work with his last work <i>“Snakes”</i> in 1969.</p> 
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>1970</b> Escher moved to a retirement home for artists called Rosa Spier Huis in Laren, Netherlands.</p>                      
                                <br/>
                                <p><b>27th March 1972</b> he died in a hospital in Hilversum, in the age of 73.</p>
